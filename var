Variables:
- Global variables (also environment variables) - 
- Local variables - can be nested

If a variable is set and it doesn't already exist in the current scope, is a new
variable created in the current scope or do we search for an existing variable in
an outer scope? Or create a new global one?

Options:
- Have separate commands or flags to create and set variables (analogous to Inferno's = and :=)
- A variable set always introduces a new local variable
-- This means there's no way to set a global?
- A variable set always introduces a new global variable
-- Can cause unexpected behaviors (see JavaScript)
- A set manipulates a variable in an outer scope if one exists, otherwise a new local variable is created
-- This seems inefficient because it means we have to check each outer scope before setting a global or creating a local
