Why a new shell?
================

1. For fun
2. Perceived problems with POSIX shells

POSIX problems
==============

Feature overlap
* When to use an alias and when to use a function?
* Quoting nightmares

Syntax issues
* What's the deal with the parentheses on function declarations?
* Inconsistent block endings (fi, done, esac)
* Syntax can't be parsed ahead of time

Shrug
=====
* Everything is a command, so much less syntax
* Distinguishes lists from 
* Blocks are first-class objects

Ancestry (need diagram)
=======================
* Bourne
** Bash
*** fish
** rc
*** es
**** xs
*** Inferno shell

The anatomy of a command
========================
* Sequence of one or more words
* The first word is special and is executed
* Remaining words are evaluated before the command is executed

Values
======
* Values can be evaluated
* Many values evaluate to themselves, such as names and blocks
* Others don't, like variables and shell evaluations
